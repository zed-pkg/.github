# Claude agent guidance

Follow ../../AGENTS.md and all repository-local policy. Resolve conflicts semantically, keep changes narrowly scoped, and report verification truthfully.

<!-- ore-org-baseline:begin -->
Read and obey [`../../agents.md`](../../agents.md); the lowercase file is canonical.

At minimum: preserve concurrent work; fetch before editing and before pushing; avoid git rebase in favor of git merge; never use `git stash`, `git reset`, `git clean`, `git filter-repo`, force-push, or another destructive operation without exact authorization; resolve conflicts semantically using the merge base, 3–10 relevant commits, tests, contracts, Linear context, and related repositories; never choose `ours` or `theirs` wholesale; scan for conflict markers; validate affected behavior; and never claim remote completion without authoritative evidence.
